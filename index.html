    <h3><b>How did Caroline Wozniacki celebrate her 2018 Australian Open win?</b></h3>
    <p> After a career that lasted 14 years, Caroline Wozniacki is ready to step out of professional tennis. The World No. 36 plans on starting a new chapter of her life to see what the future has in stock for her. She recently played her final tournament, the 2020 Australian Open, bowing out 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 to Ons Jabeur in the third round.

        To get there, she beat Kristie Ahn and an in-form 23rd seed, Dayana Yastremska. The Australian Grand Slam is particularly emotionally-worthy to Wozniacki, as it is the only Major she has won. Tennis World USA met a former member of her team, who was part of Wozniacki’s group when she captured her AO trophy in 2018.

        To remember her win and honor her departure, we asked him to share with us how the 29-year-old had celebrated her victory. “Everyone went for dinner,” he answered. “It was pretty steady. Everyone had tickets to go to another tournament on the following day, and she already was with her fiance”.

        So there is no fancy partying when a player wins a Grand Slam? Not in Wozniacki’s case, at least. “Usually, the way she celebrates a tournament is… we all go for dinner. She’s friends with Serena [Williams], she hangs out with her if they’re still in the same tournament,” he added. </p>
